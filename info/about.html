                            Went to college at <a href="http://pes.edu/" target="_blank">PES Institute of Technology</a>, Bangalore, India.
                            Graduated in 2011 with a Bachelor's degree in Information Science and Engineering.

                            Joined <a href="http://www.ittiam.com/" target="_blank">Ittiam Systems Pvt. Ltd.</a> in July 2011, now a 
                            company focussed on digital
                            media solutions, back then had a communications solution division. Worked on a
                            lot of interesting projects on MAC layer in WLANs. Improving reliability of multicast
                            traffic in WLANs, designing and implementing standard IEEE 802.11 MAC proctocols and
                            custom protocols to name a few. <br /><br />
                            Ensuring Wi-Fi certification and Chip tapeouts were a success for many customers worldwide
                            was an interesting phase in my life. It required me to travel to Shanghai at several times,
                            helped me gain a better understanding of how people in general and to be specific, Software 
                            developers go about their day-to-day activities in the workplace.<br /><br />
                            Later on, the focus in the company moved more towards the digital media solutions and as part of this,
                            I started with developing multimedia protocols like Closed Captioning and later moved on to designing a
                            web application for transcoding for video on demand as well as live stream. Although this was
                            for a short period, the experience in participating in such a design motivated me to move
                            towards working in the application domain.

                            I started Grad School at <a href="http://www.asu.edu/" target="_blank">Arizona State University</a> in January 2015 and graduated in July 2016. 
                            Pursuing a Master's degree in Compter Science, I've taken courses that are more relevant to the software development in the user space.
                            I've focussed my efforts in learning more in the areas of application development, data sciences and database systems. <br /><br />
                            I also took up a part-time job with a PhD. student where I was required to design and develop a desktop application for 
                            generation and visualization of datasets using Java and interfacing with excel. He used this application as a tool for demonstartion
                            of his work during his thesis defense.

                            Joined Brightcove in September 2016 which is a media focussed company with main intensions
                            of video delivery either on demand or through live mediums. I work on the back-end of the video system, pretty much covering different video protocols to handling storage of video or user data on either file systems or databases, handling queueing mechanisms, notifications and more such common complexities of a video system on a cloud platform.

                        I'm a cricket enthusiast. I love playing the sport. Havin said that, I haven't played since 2012. I follow test matches exclusively. When it comes to limited overs
                        cricket, I mostly reserve my attention to big events like the world cup or a champions trophy.<br /><br />
                        
                        As I neared completion of college back in 2011, I started making a little more money and started 
                        going around India watching matches at several stadiums. It was quite an experience. I do have a 
                        blog where I write about my thoughts about the happenings in and around the field. It's been quite
                        some time since I got down to writing a post on the blog because of my committments at school. I 
                        hope to resurrect the blog in the next year and a half.<br /><br />

                        I hope to travel more often now that I've finished my Master's degree.

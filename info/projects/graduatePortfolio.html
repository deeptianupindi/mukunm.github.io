                                        I would like to thank my parents, Ravi Raj Manikarnike and Sujai Mandyam Chakravarthy who have enabled me to pursue my interests in my own way.
                                        Their trust has helped me keep some sort of stability at all times and execute plans with very few diversions. My brother, Srikanth Manikarnike
                                        and sister-in-law, Smitha Sudarshan have always helped in all kinds of decisions I’ve made in the past few years. I’d like to thank them
                                        in helping me make the right calls at crucial junctures during this phase of my life. I have at several times drawn inspiration from the many
                                        stories that my grandmother, Thiruvengadamma Mandyam Chakravarthy has shared with me. Some of her thoughts have stayed with me and have helped
                                        me bring myself up to doing difficult things and I’d like to thank her for that.

                                        Pursuing my undergraduate degree in Information Science and Engineering, I was lucky to have a good set of friends as we were still getting a hang of
                                        basics of Computer Science. We’ve had a lot of fun times together, travelled to a lot of places in India and have also had serious times
                                        when we focussed on college helping us keep some kind of balance. I’d like to thank Abhijit for always keeping us entertained with his weird ways,
                                        but ways that worked half the time, Darshan for his extremely helpful nature, Subash for his good natured determination in everything that he did,
                                        Jagadish for coming up with some of the most crazy plans, Manoranjan for being brutally honest at several times, Arjun for the interesting
                                        debates that we’ve always had about many things, Shreyas for putting his best foot forward in helping the group keep in touch, Nikita for all the “thiklu”
                                        moments where we would discuss the most useless things on the planet. Several things that we've discussed as a group and what principles we believed in
                                        have stayed with me even until now.

                                        to think I became more responsible and was able to balance several things at once because of the amount of work I did and the people I met here. I’d
                                        like to thank Sudakshmina Mandal for being the inspiring manager and helping me focus on understanding several processes followed in software development
                                        and best of all making me think the way I think now because it has helped me learn to learn and that I believe is a very important tool, Harish Shetiya
                                        for helping me believe that understanding the core of concepts in making any system are extremely valuable, Rajendra Kumar for helping me think analytically
                                        about each and every tiny aspect of any system, Shivkumar Tadahal for helping me keep the required balance between fun and work and Kusmanjali Jenamoni for
                                        making the simple things much simpler and being there to share learnings as we learnt a lot of things together. Working with them has helped me learn how to
                                        take a step back when things don't go your way.

                                        I've had some of the most amazing friends, here at ASU, without whom I wouldn't have been able to complete my Masters degree to the levels of
                                        satisfaction that I've been able to achieve. Nithya has been one person with whom I've had the most number of disagreements. But, she's always
                                        been best at helping me take the much necessary breaks from school work. Fiza has been the person who has helped me keep in touch with reality at
                                        all times because she's always been extremely honest. Sushma has always been a very positive person with a very infectious smile and I'd like thank her
                                        for keeping the happines quotient high.  Vivek has been one person who has come up with crazy plans for us to do as a group and we've made a lot of memories
                                        because of that. Last, but not the least, Sanjeev has been an incredible roommate, a confidant and an amazing friend overall. We've had a lot of "funny"
                                        memories together. Without all of these guys around, the past year and a half would have been quite ordinary and I'd like to thank them for making it

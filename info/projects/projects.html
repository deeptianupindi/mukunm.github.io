                                        As more and more applications move to the cloud, the number of users interacting with any application is set to increase. 
                                        This increase will require applications to promise faster query response times which can be fulfilled by porting databases 
                                        to the main memory. In order to do this, certain optimizations that have been made to databases keeping in mind that they 
                                        would fit into secondary storage would have to be tweaked so that they do well on the main memory as well. This paper 
                                        describes a framework that we implemented1 to allow the database to be ported to the main memory and have indexes use the 
                                        database. It also describes the several already existing techniques that have been explored in this area, provides a summary 
                                        of the current research that has already been carried out, how the survey has affected the key aspects that our project aims 
                                        to explore and measures the performance of a few index structures on the main memory database framework.

                                        As the number of users interacting with web based applications increase, the number of such applications increase 
                                        and there is going to be a constant demand for fine-tuning how content is served up to each user with the aim of 
                                        maximizing user satisfaction. This paper illustrates how such custom content can be served up to users by using a 
                                        recommender system. Certain techniques like collaborative filtering, content based recommender are explored and 
                                        their performance is compared by using measures like root mean square error and mean absolute error. 
                                        The recommender system uses restaurant data from Yelp provided by Yelp as part of Round 7 of the Yelp dataset challenge.

                                        This paper focuses on application of game theory in software development project management strategies. 
                                        The most important part of a successful project is a competent Task management strategy. It includes distributing 
                                        the tasks in a project among the team members (Software engineers, Quality testers, Project planners etc.) in a 
                                        way that will motivate every team member to give their best efforts which in turn will aid in rewarding outcome as 
                                        the project finishes. This paper takes the ideas from the auction concepts and distributes the tasks to the team 
                                        members by calculating the best allocation strategies considering various variables like time to complete tasks, 
                                        preference factors, effort estimates. The project manager can use this strategy to compute the utilities for various 
                                        stages in a project and distribute the task in a way that will satisfy the team members as well as yield a successful final product.

                                As part of this course, I developed two projects.

                                            This project involved students selecting a website of their choice subject to a 2 student per website limit, crawling the site for
                                            datasets, analyzing them using certain graph measures and simulating well known graph models to see how well they match up to the 
                                            actual graph obtained through crawling.<br /><br />

                                            The website I was able to get was Twoo.com which is a dating website and hence user links aren't publicly available and had to be
                                            created using location as a social similarity. The crawler was written using Scrapy in Python.

                                            As of today, there is a lot of data in the form of blogs, posts, and microblogs from users from varied communities, locations and 
                                            coming from different backgrounds. Given the varied background of people that use all of these platforms and create such varied 
                                            data sources, there is often a need to retrieve this data. One such mechanism that Twitter (a microblogging site) uses is a concept 
                                            called Hashtags which are an ever growing set of indices for retrieval. The way it varies from the typical indices is that these 
                                            indices are ever-growing, user created and similar such hashtags could be named differently although in reality, they represent the 
                                            same thing. The problem this project addresses is of achieving prediction of hashtags for a tweet that doesn’t have any hashtags by 
                                            learning from a tweet dataset that contains hashtags. The basic principle that this project explores is learning based on the 
                                            similarity of words in the tweets.

                                    Certain SOAP and REST services were developed as part of this project using
                                    the Windows communication foundation. The focus of these services was centered
                                    around building a system that would help ease exploring SOAP services available
                                    on the web. The link provided above is a web application built using ASP.Net and
                                    hosted on IIS that provides a powerful search engine to explore SOAP services
                                    and perform test invocations on them.

                                                This is an autonomous robot which uses an Atmega16 Microcontroller for intelligence,
                                                stepper motors to move around and IR sensor to detect obstacles used to solve a 
                                                maze. The robot came with drivers to manipulate the IR sensor and rotate the stepper
                                                motors. We implemented an algorithm called the flood filled algorithm to use these
                                                basic funcationalities in order to solve the maze. The algorithm basically sees a 
                                                a maze as a matrix which gets filled as and when the mouse visits a block in the maze
                                                The aim is to reach the center which is detected when no walls are found around the

                                    I worked in the early stages of this project where my role was to make design choices
                                    like the kind of application framework to be used, deployment strategies to be followed,
                                    deciding on the folder structure to be followed. At the time that I finished working on this
                                    project, we had chosen to work with the YII framework, use Vagrant and Chef to automate
                                    deployment tasks. I finished with building a folder structure for the project and having
                                    a flow for all the models, views and controllers.

                                    My role while working on this project varied with the time I spent on it.<br />
                                    I initially started with designing algorithms to achieve reliability for multicast
                                    traffic. We used simulation on NS3 to implement and measure the improvement in 
                                    reliability. <br /><br />
                                    Later on, I worked on designing and implementing custom as well as standard IEEE 802.11
                                    MAC protocols. These protocols were run on a PowerPC processor hosted on a platform that
                                    contained FPGAs for the MAC layer's H/W as well as the Physical layer's HW combined with 
                                    an ADC-DAC connected to an RF Chain to transmit to and receive packets from the air.<br /><br />
                                    Initially I worked on 802.11n MAC. When we started to move to 802.11ac, the throughput
                                    requirements needed us to re-design the entire MAC by pushing a large part of the data 
                                    path into HW. I worked on this project for a brief period before winding up my work on 
                                    Wi-Fi.

                                    Working in the Wi-Fi team, we would have several access points, stations, routers,
                                    boards and PCs. We would typically work in labs spread across different places in 
                                    the building. Eventually, sharing these devices across the team would become a very
                                    hassle. So, I developed an inventory tracking desktop application using swings
                                    in Java using a MySQL database as the backend to store inventory and user information.
                                    This project was widely appreciated by all members in the team and was recognized with
                                    a Spot award.

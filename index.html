          Here is a brief summary of myself.
        </p>
        <p class = "rss-subscribe">
          I completed my undergraduate degree in 2011 in Information Science at PES Institute of Technology, Bangalore.
          From 2011 - 2014, I was working at Ittiam systems Pvt. Ltd., Bangalore where I worked on
          embedded systems for the most part, the application being MAC layer design and implementation
          for WLANs. I've been responsible for interaction with customers as well during this phase and have
          helped customers solve crucial issues during phases of Wi-Fi Certification or Chip Tapeout which
          required me to travel to Shanghai on quite a few occasions<br/><br/>

          I've also worked on a few applications, both web and desktop. One of them was an inventory tracking
          system which was built as a desktop application. I'm quite familiar with Swings
          in Java, web application frameworks like Yii, Spring and ASP.Net.

          I'm currently pursuing my Master's in Computer Science and will graduate in the Fall of 2016.
          I'm looking to shift my focus more towards the application domain. Having worked mostly in the
          systems domain, as I've progressed in attaining my degree, I've been looking at learning more
          by registering for courses that are more relevant to this domain like Distributed Software
          development, Social Media mining and so on. <br/><br/>

          I'm also working with an Environmental Science Graduate student to help him build a desktop application
          using swings in Java to perform certain statistical analysis of the life of Toxic substances in different
          media.

          I would be completing more than half of my course work by the end of December, 2015 and will be looking for an
          internship in the next spring.<br/><br/>

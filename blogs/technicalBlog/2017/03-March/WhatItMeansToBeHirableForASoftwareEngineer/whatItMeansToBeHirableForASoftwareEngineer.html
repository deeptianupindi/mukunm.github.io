                <p style="text-align:justify">
                    There is a lot of stuff that goes into the making of any software product/ software-hardware product/ software service. The main ingredients to the making of a good product are code, processes, infrastructure and technology. It is important to understand these categories to be successful in the tech industry. 
                </p>

                <p style="text-align:justify">
                    <b>Code</b><br/>
                    This is basically the set of instructions you write to get the several software components that you as a programmer use to interface with the hardware components to finally get your computation output in a successful and efficient manner. In doing this, you are expected to write efficient code (both time and space-wise) that is readable, modular and well documented.   
                </p>

                <p style="text-align:justify">
                    <b>Process</b><br/>
                    This includes the processes you follow to version and maintain all resources that you as a software engineer use or produce, documentation of every resource you use or produce, so on and so forth. Depending on which rung in the hierarchy as an engineer you are, you might also be expected to review, alter and/or create processes for the same and also for things like interviews, mentoring new hires, dictating how sales requirements are translated to engineering and inter-team interactions.
                </p>

                <p style="text-align:justify">
                    <b>Infrastructure</b><br/>
                    This includes the infrastructure that you use to build your application and this is true for all forms software/software-hardware applications. If you’re developing a purely software only service or product, the cloud infrastructure that you’re running your service on or the OS for which you’re developing your product becomes your infrastructure. If you’re developing a software-hardware product, the processor that you use among other components on your platform becomes the infrastructure. Since these are the building blocks that enable building your application, understanding of this is key to being successful at what you build.
                </p>

                <p style="text-align:justify">
                    <b>Technology</b><br/>
                    The last, and the most important of all, technology is the application itself that you’re trying to build. It could be any specific problem that you’re trying to solve. Examples of the technology could be an audio solution, a video solution, a management and financial software and many more such things that fall in several layers of the TCP/IP stack. This means that understanding technology means understanding several of the algorithms and data structures that might be popular in that technology becomes a big part of gaining expertise in that area. 
                </p>

                <p style="text-align:justify">
                    Having said what entails gaining expertise in each of these areas, it is important to know that an ideal Software Engineer is supposed to be good at all of the above four aspects to be successful at a job. However, there is almost never a case where someone is good at all of these, which is why companies build teams to compensate for what one is lacking in another. 
                </p>

                <p style="text-align:justify">
                    As an undergraduate student, you’re taught to build everything from the basics, which is to be good at code and processes. There is a lot of emphasis on generic algorithms and data-structures, which is the most important thing that educational systems are doing. You’re also taught about some infrastructure like operating systems, how distributed systems work and so on. But, the emphasis on this isn’t as high. It’s almost the same with focus on technology as well isn’t as high in an undergraduate education which is understandable because an undergraduate education aims to build a solid foundation. When you pursue a Master’s degree, a PhD or work for a technology focused company, is when you build expertise in certain technology areas and become proficient on a certain infrastructure.
                </p>

                <p style="text-align:justify">
                    If you look at this from an industry standpoint, they are trying to make as much of the available resources or employees to produce the highest quality output in a short period of span. This is logical because, in a capitalistic world, incentives are only for people who contribute to the larger goal in a measurable fashion. Whether being capitalistic is more advantageous over being socialistic has been debated largely and I will reserve that debate for another post. Given that we’re capitalistic and we’re trying to maximize gain, all companies in the tech industry look for more expertise in Infrastructure and Technology rather than just being good at code and processes. Each company quizzes a potential candidate in all of the 4 areas. But, the proportions are largely concentrated in the Infrastructure and Technology areas.
                </p>

                <p style="text-align:justify">
                    This, according to skills gained in an undergraduate degree would mean that a higher degree becomes a must to secure a job. But, the industry tries to fill that gap by hiring interns which doesn’t solve the problem at large, but does push the problem in the right direction. Hence, it is very important to get the required expertise in a certain technology and some infrastructure to be hirable in a capitalistic industry.

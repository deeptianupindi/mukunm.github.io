                <br />
                <p style="text-align:justify">
                    In the early days of technology, people were creating software without much thought to documentation of software design or test results. As more and more software was being created and the amount of usage increased, there came the requirement of more maintenance and hence motivated people to come up with formalized Software Engineering practices. This was very much an afterthought and helped millions of Software Engineers around the world communicate better, move upward or downward the version control registry with much ease and make any piece of software last longer.                 
                </p>

                <p style="text-align:justify">
                    As software development moved farther away from the underlying hardware and from the Operating System, more and more Software Engineers came into the loop because software development had become a lot easier. Alongside this increase, the software that was closer to hardware and hardware itself stabilized, several of the software developed for much of the lower layers of the network stack including the physical, link and transport layers as well stabilized. Hence, a large part of the software development that is now going on is on the application layer.
                </p>

                <p style="text-align:justify">
                    The key difference between development on lower layers and on the application layer is the fact that several of the functionalities required are built in-house on the lower layers whereas on the application layer, development is driven by the usage of a lot of libraries and external modules driven by HTTP calls. The other difference was also that software developed on lower layers was maintained and repaired as and when needed for a much longer lifetime, whereas on the application layer, software lives for a much lesser time. The moment the issues start increasing, they get thrown out and rebuilt.
                </p>

                <p style="text-align:justify">
                    Software developed for lower layers were built with much care and hence, one could find a lot of documented help for using them. However, the current day application layer software, which by the way is where the most amount of work is happening these days, is hardly documented at a large percentage of the technology companies. The reasons are two-fold.
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Because most of the business logic in current day application layer is built using libraries and hence developers feel that there isn’t much of a value add in documenting that small bit added on top of what the library does.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The application usually lives for a short period of time before which it gets torn down due to issues and hence people feel that there is no need to waste engineering hours on documenting something that is anyway going to get torn down.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>

                <p style="text-align:justify">
                    The reasons why the above stated reasons fail to justify the lack of documentation are
                    <ol>
                        <li>
                            Documentations of libraries and modules driven by HTTP calls are created with the perspective of the library or the external module and hence, the business logic is never captured if the application layer software is never captured.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Perhaps, one might think that the short timespan might be a good reason to not document an application’s business logic. But, it only indicates lack of foresight because eventually a customer will come back and say that there’s an issue and no developer can remember everything. It also shows disbelief in the software that one is developing.
                        </li>
                    </ol>
                </p>

                <p style="text-align:justify">
                    Creating documentation about a minute piece of business logic on top of an existing library with a different perspective is still a value-add and contributes to the betterment of the company by saving engineering hours in the future. By no means, is it a waste of engineering hours as several of the current day developers treat it.

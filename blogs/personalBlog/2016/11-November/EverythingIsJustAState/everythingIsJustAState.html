                    The title is intriguing, a good start to the post and many more such things, one might say. But, all I’m about to say is that everything in this world is just a state, there’s no better or worse. Well, what the hell does that mean? Let’s delve into some specifics.
                </p>

                <p style="text-align:justify">
                    If you think about how we came into existence, we started growing from a single cell which then undergoes cell division to form multiple cells grouping into organs, the organs then connecting with each other, all happening in the protective bag, the uterus until, the organism can survive on it’s own. So, how does this cell division happen? We’re not creating matter because we can’t do that according to the law of conservation of mass. Cell division happens with supplements that are provided to the cell through our intake of food and air. So, our cells are internally composed of certain elements found in nature or compounds formed out of them. This isn’t anything new. But, it’s the basis for what I’m going to state henceforth, in this post. Since, we have established that all our body parts are basically constituted of certain elements like carbon, oxygen and many more, we now can safely assume that what we call human is basically a set of elements that exist in nature.
                </p>

                <p style="text-align:justify">
                    Moving on to the human experience and what it exactly represents, we know that we have five senses and some might say we have the sixth as well. All these senses are basically an input/output to/from the entity that we call human to the outside world. If analyzed carefully, all these senses represent a set of mappings that the brain comes up with to what energy a light source is exhibiting, what frequency a sound source is emitting and so on. So, if you think about it, everything that these senses receive as input is reduced to some kind of state in the brain.
                </p>

                <p style="text-align:justify">
                    From what was discussed earlier, we now know that everything that the human body is made of is just a certain set of elements that exist in nature. This means that the brain is also made up of some of these elements as well. Since, everything that we perceive through some senses is reduced to some kind of state in the brain, it basically means that everything that we perceive is a certain state that the elements that the brain is made up of, are exhibiting. So, all of our thoughts and what we’ve seen, heard, touched, eaten and so on is merely a certain state that a set of elements existing in the nature exhibited. So, everything that a person likes or dislikes is also just another state that these elements are exhibiting. Now, people might argue that if that were to be true, everyone should reach the same state since we all have the same organs. But, that’s not true because as each cell divides forming organs and much more, they form differently because of different supplements and amount of the same being received by different individuals. Hence, we have different sized organs, so on and so forth.
                </p>

                <p style="text-align:justify">
                    Now, everything in this universe is built of certain elements, which we see, feel, smell, taste and so on. If everything we experience is nothing but a state that a certain set of elements exhibit, it should mean that everything in this world is just a certain state. How do you compare these states and say that they’re better or worse?
                </p>

                <p style="text-align:justify">
                    A lot of people would disagree with what I’m saying here which is fine because I think that’s just another state. ;) I’m just kidding. I’d like to know what the people who disagree with me have to say. The people who agree with this line of thinking might say that all of this completely makes sense. But, if this were to be true, why do we do anything at all. We’ve built civilizations over the past so many centuries and we continue to do so. We discourage people who go against society, engage in terrorism and so on. What I think about that is that if everything is just a state, it doesn’t matter what we do. Because of different constituent organs that we have, we exhibit different states in reaction with different inputs from the environment and thereby we do what is the best state for our organs based on some kind of feedback mechanism. It’s basically the mechanism that elements exhibit where they transition to excited state and come back to stable state. To answer the second part where we discourage people from going against society, I think that has fortunately been a stable state that most of us exhibit which is something that has helped us form civilizations. Essentially, I think humans are just a group of compounds, which have similar stable states and that is all there is to it. If we’re trying to do anything that has some kind of a purpose or trying to solve some kind of a problem, it’s only a certain state that the group of compounds in our body exhibit. So, none of these purposes or things we try to do really mean anything. This kind of thinking can be construed as destructive to the society and so on which is not true because every act of common good that all civilizations have come up with, do have a certain meaning within that realm. But, in the realm of the entire universe it really doesn’t matter because the universe itself goes through cycles of dwindling into nothing and growing again.
